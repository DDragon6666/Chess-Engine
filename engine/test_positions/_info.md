Stores positions as
fen : good moves
Though most will only have 1 good move
e.g.
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 : e2e4, d2d4, c2c4, g1f3, g2g3

maybe more than 100 positions per file if i can get it to automatically add certain types of positions to the correct file. Maybe lichess has puzzle types already sorted which can be downloaded.
LICHESS DOES :D

have different difficulties split by something like
difficult 0

difficult 1
medium puzzles
difficult 2

difficult 3
